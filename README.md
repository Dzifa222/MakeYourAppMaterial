## Project Overview
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

## Features
* Implement the Shared Element Transition
* Customize the animation using PageTransformer
* Show a Snackbar with a button that allows to perform an action
* Use CoordinatorLayout, CollapsingToolbarLayout
* Create a custom ThreeTwoImageView to make all the images have the same proportion

## Rubric
* App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
* App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
* App theme extends from AppCompat.
* App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
* App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
* App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
* App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
* App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
* App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
* App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.
* App utilizes stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio.
